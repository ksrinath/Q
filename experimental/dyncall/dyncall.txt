We would like to confirm that we can call any of the core C functions 
from Lua using both Dyncall and LuaJit FFI

In particular, all C functions have the following signature

1) they will *ALL* return a single integer as a status

2) if the function needs to return a  value, then it will look something 
like the example shown below. Note that in this case, status is not used 
but in general it is used to indicate that something has gone wrong.

int
sum(
  int32_t *X,
  int n,
  int64_t *ptr_sum
)
{
  int status = 0;
  uint64_t sum = 0;
  for ( int i = 0; i < n; i++ ) { 
    sum += X[i];
  }
  *ptr_sum = sum;
  return status;
}

1) Note the difference between X and ptr_sum. While both are pointers, 
their meaning is different. X refers to an array whereas ptr_sum is the 
address of a scalar.

=================================================

3) The 6 types that need to be supported are
int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t, float, double, char

Bonus points for being able to support 
uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t

=================================================

Assignment 1: Specifically, what I would like you to do is to make sure 
that we can support *ALL* the types mentioned above. 

The aim is to convince us that we can 

1) return all the different types of values (e.g., ptr_sum in the
example could be *double, *float, *int32_t, …..)

2) the C function iterates through the data correctly for all
different input data types i.e., in the example, X can be int8_t *,
int16_t *, …. So, I don’t care what function it is (sum may be good
enough) as long as it convinces us that we are iterating through the
data correctly

3) this means that you will need to create small binary files as
inputs and mmap them and send the pointers in to the C
function. Indrajeet has done this already. Please steal from him.

BTW, the reason for this work is 2-fold

1) It de-risks the project. If there are any gotchas, we need to know
them early

2) It serves as a reference implementation. So, as newer people get on
to the project, I can point them at small , comprehensible,
stand-alone units of work that allow them to get a sense of how the
whole system works.

Assignment 2: Would like a wrapper which makes the Lua programmer 
oblivious of whether FFI is being used or Dyncall is being used. Under 
the covers, depending on some global variable, we will go down one path 
or the other.
